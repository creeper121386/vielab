`vielab` means Video / Image Enhancement Lab, containing multiple kinds of deep learning based enhancement methods:

- [x] DeepLPF
- [ ] 3D-LUT

## Config your model

### Training

The project use `Hydra` to manage config files. Config files are located in `./src/config`. `./src/config/config.yaml`
contains two parts: general configs for all experiments and config groups for each experiment. General config looks
like:

```yaml
name: default_name    # name of experiment
num_epoch: 1000
gpu: 1
valid_every: 10
log_every: 100
save_model_every: 20
model_path: false # false for do not load runtime. Necessary when testing.
```

Config groups contains `ds`, `aug` and `runtime`. Each config group is defined in directory `./src/config/<group_name>`.
For example, if you want to create a new config file for group `ds`, just create `./src/config/ds/local-debug.yaml` and
fill it. In such a yaml file, you need to add an extra line at the beginning:

```
# @package _group_
```

which means using the group name as package when including this yaml file.

If you have finished modified the `yaml` file, you need 4 steps to run a model:

- choose your dataset by passing command line arguments `+ds=<dataset_name>`
- choose your model and runtime config by passing command line arguments `+runtime=<model_name>.<runtime_config>`
- (not necessary) modify extra general configs if you want, for example: `aug=crop512`
- (not necessary) modify any config option if you want, for example: `aug.resize=true`. Note that if the arguments
  conflict, the previous argument will be overwritten by the later one.

Finally, your command looks like:

```shell
python train.py +ds=my_data +runtime=deeplpf.config1 aug=resize runtime.loss.ltv=0.001 gpu=2 name=demo1
```

### What about testing and evaluation?

Assume that you have created config files for training a model. I suggest you only change those necessary parameters
when testing/evaluating the same model. (like `name` and `model_path`) Just left other parameters their default value
and don't care about them. indeed, when you do so, some parameters for training like `num_epoch`, `valid_every` will
also be loaded at the same time, but it's OK cause `test.py` and `eval.py` will ignore them.

If you want to define some extra necessary parameters for testing/evaluation other than training parameters, you could
create a new `yaml` in `runtime` group.

### Reference

If you are still confused about the config process of the project, I recommend you to
read [Hydra documentation](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro). Trust me, although `Hydra` looks more complicated, it's much
better than `argparse` in deep learning project.
